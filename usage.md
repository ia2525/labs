Manual Testing Instruction

This repository was created precisely for testing this function. You should be working from the "Labs" folder, under which you will see the cpi_data excel file, which we will primarily be working with. 

For this lab, we will test three data uploading methods: append, trunc, and incremental to understand how they work differently.
